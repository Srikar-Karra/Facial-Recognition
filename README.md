# Facial-Recognition_Authentication
With this code, you will need a webcam and need to install all the dependicies. 
This code can be used for anything like authentication or functions like putting your computer to sleep if you arent there.
You can make this work by deleting the while loop and changing it from there.
Some examples of what you can use this code for is using this to authenticate you into a password manager script etc...

Hope you like the script!!
